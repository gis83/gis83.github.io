In the past I have provided teaching support for the modules: Human-AI Interaction (COMP3074), Design Ethnography (COMP4017), Code First: Girls (Python basics), Mobile Device Programming (G53MDP), Code First: Girls (Web development), and Mixed Reality Technologies (G54MRT).

I am open to supervise one or two HCI master's dissertations during summer 2024. Please have a look at my [research publications](/publications) to get familiar with some of the topics I'd be interested in supervising. Other themes include Responsible AI, critical computing, and feminist HCI. 

I'll update this space in early 2024 for more specific project ideas.
