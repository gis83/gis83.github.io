In the past I have provided teaching support for the modules: Human-AI Interaction (COMP3074), Design Ethnography (COMP4017), Code First: Girls (Python basics), Mobile Device Programming (G53MDP), Code First: Girls (Web development), and Mixed Reality Technologies (G54MRT).

I supervise undergraduate and postgraduate's projects on HCI and HRI topics, for instance related to telepresence robots and technologies for accessibility. 

I am open to supervise HCI master's dissertations during the summer. Please have a look at my [research publications](/publications) to get familiar with some of the topics I'd be interested in supervising. Other themes include Responsible AI, critical computing, and feminist HCI.
