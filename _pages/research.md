## Reframing disability as competency: Unpacking everyday technology practices of people with visual impairments.

### Motivation:
A great deal of previous research into accessibility and assistive technology has focused on investigating physical and digital barriers experienced by people with disabilities in order to remove them. By contrast, this research aims to build upon work that has called for centering research in ability rather than disability (Wobbrock et. al, 2011), by focusing on the practices people with visually impairments habitually perform when using technology and the competencies they develop to ‘get by’ in life, drawing on ethnomethodology’s emphasis on situated competencies (Garfinkel, 1967, p. 57) as the “capability of managing one’s everyday affairs without interference”.

### The study:
I conducted a four-month ethnographic study facilitated by a local branch of a UK charity that supports people with visual impairments. This study explored mainstream and assistive technology use within their everyday lives. In this [CHI 2020 paper](../files/Reframing disability as competency.pdf), we identified three main sites for technology use from the data collected: social relations and communication practices, textual reading practices, and mobility practices.

Via an ethnographic approach we contribute to understanding how people accomplish such practices, and in doing so, uncover the practical competencies that enable people with visual impairments to conduct their everyday activities. Thus we investigate how disability can be thought of in terms of competencies, arguing that understanding of competencies can enrich the design of technologies that fit the needs of people with visual impairments.


## An ethnographic study of peoples's strategies to avoid food waste (Master's dissertation)

### Motivation:
Disturbing volumes of food waste generation around the world have been recently reported. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 2011) estimate that one third of food is wasted or lost each year worldwide. It has also been reported that in developed countries about half of food waste generated in a year comes from households (Quested & Parry, 2011). Although government policies and campaigns have been created to reduce these amounts, very little has been done to thoroughly understand the practices and activities that trigger the generation of food waste inside households, and the strategies that are presently used to avoid it.

### Aims of research:
* To investigate and understand the strategies that people use to avoid food waste in households.
* From these findings explore what technology can do to support such strategies.

### The study:
I conducted an ethnographic study in three different households for three weeks carrying out fieldwork combined with semi-structured and contextual interviews, diaries and instant messaging data. Strategies to avoid food waste were identified within ordinary activities related to food such as shopping, storing, preparing, cooking, eating and discarding. Important factors to accomplish such strategies, and possible areas to be supported by technology, were ascertained through analysis. I generated a set of design requirements informed by the study findings, and based on them I designed and evaluated an interactive paper-based prototype of a mobile app.
