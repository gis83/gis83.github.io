Hola! I am a Research Fellow at the [Trustworthy Autonomous Systems](https://tas.ac.uk/) (TAS) Hub in the University of Nottingham. I am based in the School of Computer Science, as part of the [Mixed Reality Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mixedrealitylab/) and [Horizon Digital Economy Research](https://www.horizon.ac.uk/).

My area of research is [Human Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction) (HCI). Currently, I am investigating collaboration with, trust in, and the feasibility of, autonomous and robotic systems. My background sits at the intersection between Human Computer Interaction, Accessibility, and Ethnomethodology. 

My doctoral research presented a design critique of how disability is framed in technology design and provided an approach for centring the competencies and participation of visually impaired people in early-stage design.
