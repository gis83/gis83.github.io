Hola! I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. I am based in the School of Computer Science and I am a member of the [Mixed Reality Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mixedrealitylab/).

My area of research is [Human Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction) (HCI). My PhD focuses on technology use by people with visual impairments and the methods they employ to accomplish everyday activities, drawing on [ethnomethodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnomethodology) to uncover people's competencies that could inform and support accessible technology design practices. I am also interested in how voice technologies are or could be used to improve accessibility. My supervisors are [Joel Fischer](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszjf1/) and [Stuart Reeves](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszsr/index.html#). I am supported by the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology ([CONACYT](https://www.conacyt.gob.mx/index.php)).

I hold a MSc in Human Computer Interaction from the University of Nottingham in the UK and a BSc in Computer Systems Engineering from the Pachuca Institute of Technology in Mexico.
