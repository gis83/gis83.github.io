Hola! I am a Transitional Assistant Professor at the University of Nottingham. I am part of the [Trustworthy Autonomous Systems](https://tas.ac.uk/) (TAS) Hub and [Responsible AI UK](https://www.rai.ac.uk/) research programmes. I am based in the School of Computer Science, as member of the [Mixed Reality Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mixedrealitylab/) and [Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute](https://www.horizon.ac.uk/).

I research [Human Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction) (HCI) and [Human Robot Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-robot-interaction) (HRI). As part of the TAS Hub, I have been investigating interaction, trust, and public acceptance of, a range of autonomous and robotic systems; from mobile apps that have, or may have, a component that works autonomously, to robots that can navigate a physical space on their own, such as telepresence robots. 

My recent projects include [exploring the deployment of robots in museums](https://tas.ac.uk/tas-hub-projects/terplay/) (PI) and the effect of [social robots' non-verbal behaviours (e.g. nodding while listening) in human-robot interaction](https://tas.ac.uk/research-projects-2023-24/tas-gail-go-ahead-im-listening/) (Co-I). 

My research interests also include fine-grained analysis of interaction (using [ethnomethodology and conversation analysis](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-23864-007)), accessibility and social-justice oriented HCI. My doctoral work presented a design critique of how disability is framed in technology design and provided a framework for centring the competencies and participation of visually impaired people in HCI research and design.
